# September 2019 update

So I can pretty much say I have failed most if not all of my goals for 2019 so
far.

<!-- more -->
I have managed to read two really good books and managed to only buy one more.
So sorta kept that one, except I bought one of the two I read, so didn't manage
the two out - one in as I should have.

I would hugely recommend both books I did read, firstly finally finished the
Rust Book (which is available for free online
[here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)), and secondly read through the
fascinating [Building Git](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/) - I would
100% recommend this book to anyone interested in software development.

Blog more - well it is obvious that hasn't happened.

Work more on OSS projects - not really had brainspace for this.

Rust Web framework - same here.

And generally be healthier - not really managed this, think I am probably eating
better, but not significantly so.

However I have had some updates - I am now 6 months into a new job which has
been truly amazing for me, I felt in my last role I was rapidly approaching a
growth wall, and this job I feel like I am really improving as a developer, and
have enjoyed working on projects with a decent amount of end users.

This job also has a shorter commute which has given me back more time, and I
feel less generally tired than I did, I hope to use this time productively but
seem at the moment unable to do so.
